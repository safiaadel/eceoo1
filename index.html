     <p> <font size="5" face="arial" >Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines
     that can accomplish activities that would normally need human intelligence. Although AI is a multidisciplinary discipline
     with many methodologies, advances in machine learning and deep learning are causing a paradigm shift in nearly every sector
    of the IT industry.</font> </p>

     <b><p> <font size="6" face="arial" > <u>History Of Artifical Intelligence:</u></font>  </p></b>
     <p> <font size="5" face="arial"> Ancient Greek mythology included sentient robots and
     artificial entities for the first time. The creation of the syllogism and its application of
     deductive reasoning by Aristotle was a watershed point in humanity's
      search to comprehend its own intelligence.</font></p>
